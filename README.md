# B.Tech-Mini-Project-PCM-in-MATLAB
Simulation of PCM in MATLAB for audio signal.
Import pcm.m, use an audio of your choice and you're done.
The code has been made as clear as possible with comments for better understanding.
Please change F(the sampling rate of the audio file) from 44100/48000 to 1000 so as to distinguish between the signals.
For nyquist rate, take n1 as 450, for undersampling, take n1 as 3000, for oversampling, take n1 as 100.
